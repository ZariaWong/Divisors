# Divisors

The program will ask the user for two integers a and b such that 0 < a < b. Next, the user will be prompted to enter divisors (one or more). All divisors d should be 0 < d <= band integers. The user should be prompted again until the input is suitable. 

# Outputs

- An M in the upper left corner

- The first row, after the M, will contain the divisors in ascending order with repeated elements omitted

- The first column after the M will contain all integers from a to b-1 in ascending order

- A 1 at row i and column j if the i-th integer is divisible by the j-th divisor, otherwise a 0

Matrix elements are separated by a space.
